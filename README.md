# **Keychain - Secure Password Manager Microservice**

**Keychain** is a microservice designed to securely store, retrieve, and manage passwords and sensitive credentials. It provides an encrypted vault for password management, ensuring that your secrets are stored and accessed safely with industry-standard cryptographic techniques.

## Key Features:
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypts passwords using strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a simple and efficient API to manage passwords, with endpoints for adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting credentials.
- **User Authentication**: Supports robust user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access their password vault.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks actions related to password access and modification for accountability and security auditing.
- **Password Generation**: Includes a built-in password generator to create strong and random passwords.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Can be integrated with other systems or services using its REST API, enabling use in web applications, mobile apps, or enterprise systems.

## Technologies:
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data encryption
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access control
- **API**: RESTful API built with Flask or FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite or a NoSQL solution for secure data storage
- **Security**: Strong password hashing with bcrypt or Argon2

## How It Works:
1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users register and authenticate via secure methods like JWT tokens.
2. **Storing Passwords**: Users can securely store passwords using the API, with all data encrypted before saving.
3. **Retrieving Passwords**: Only authorized users can decrypt and retrieve passwords from their vault.
4. **Password Updates and Deletions**: Users can securely update or delete passwords, and changes are logged for security purposes.

## Use Cases:
- **Personal Password Management**: For individual users who need a secure way to store and manage passwords.
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Used by organizations to securely store credentials for applications, APIs, and services.

## Why Keychain?
- **Security First**: Built with strong cryptography and user privacy in mind.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing applications via the REST API.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both small and large-scale deployments, handling user authentication and password storage efficiently.
